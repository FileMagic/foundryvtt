    <figcaption>Welcome to the Foundry Virtual Tabletop update notes for Version 0.8.9.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Hello Foundry Virtual Tabletop community! We are excited to release Foundry Virtual Tabletop version 0.8.9, intended to be the final release for the Version 0.8.x series of updates. Version 0.8.9 focuses on clearing a wide variety of fixes for bugs reported by our dilligent community during the 0.8.8 feedback period and in addition brings some necessary but small API changes to assist our awesome community of developers.</p>

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> Version 0.8.8 is labeled as a stable release, but there is always the possibility of unexpected bugs or module compatibility issues. We do not recommend updating immediately prior to a game session unless you are confident in your own ability to troubleshoot any issues that arise. As always, performing a backup of your user data prior to update is recommended.</p>

<h2 class="border">Update Highlights</h2>

<p>As an update on the Stable channel, this release focused primarily on bug fixes and we resolved a wide variety of different issues, with the most changes occurring in relation to the Game Canvas as well as Documents and Data handling. This is to be expected given the majority of changes in 0.8.x were related to the implementations of Documents as well as changes related to the Canvas in order to support Overhead Tiles. The new approach to Audio also saw some bug fixes related to rendering of UI elements as well as one prominent fix for a recurring audio issue which could cause playlists to stop playing.</p>

<h4>Fixes for Prominent Bugs</h4>
    <p>Audio playlists experienced a return of a previous bug which could result in audio ceasing to play if you had recently played 'too many' audio tracks. We have implemented a new method of closing out the connections established for playing audio which should prevent this bug from occurring.</p>
    <p>Lights and Walls received some pretty significant fixes, returning the behaviour of previewing lights before updating the application, and hopefully addressing some of the rare bugs which could occur with click-handling when chaining walls using ctrl(cmd for you Mac users.) In addition, tokens with vision set to 0 no longer leave helpful breadcrumbs erasing their fog of war exploration, and toggling a light on and off without moving a token should properly reveal fog of war.</p>
    <p>We changed how Foundry VTT detects when a user is connected to make it less dependent on the canvas, which should now correctly show when people are connected regardless of whether or not they've disabled the canvas. </p>
    <p>In addition, to prevent errors that could be caused by switching scenes while a scene was still loading, it is no longer possible to do so.</p>
        
<h4>Documentation Changes</h4>
    <p>Thanks to the great efforts of our developer community reporting inconsistencies in our API documentation, we were able to make about a dozen corrections to a wide variety of JSDoc strings including the creation of some new entries in the API docs where the documentation needed a bit more detail.</p>

<h2 class="border">New Features</h2>
    <h3>Documents and Data</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Dragging a Journal Entry from a Compendium to the canvas now imports the entry into the world and then creates a Map Note for that entry. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/5719" target="_blank">(5719)</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Interface and Applications</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The direction of the expand/collapse indicator on the Players UI window has been reversed so that it is now consistent with UI/UX elsewhere in the software. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/5565" target="_blank">(5565)</a></li>
        <li>To prevent module-added buttons from overrunning vertical screenspace, the canvas layer controls toolbar buttons now wrap. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/5648" target="_blank">(5648)</a></li>
        <li>The terminology used on menus which previously mentioned 'Entity' now correctly use 'Document'. <a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/5664" target="_blank">(5664)</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Dice System</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Deferred inline rolls now use <code>Roll.replaceFormulaData()</code> to ensure that formulae which include references to actor data are resolved as part of the roll.<a href="https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/5577" target="_blank">(5577)</a></li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>

    <figcaption>Welcome to the Foundry Virtual Tabletop update notes for Version 9 API Development 2.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We are proud to announce the final update in our API Development phase for Version 9! As we move into the user testing phase we look forward to refining the UX and UI of all the features we have implemented up to this point. As you all know Version 9 has focused on implementing the new Adaptive Lighting system, introduced Card Support, and has continually added new minor features or polish to the existing API. During the API Development phase, we have introduced a number of positive changes and refinements to the API and the underlying structures which support those focused goals. </p>

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> Updates on the Development channel are intended for testing and feedback from the development community. While the features and improvements of these updates may be close to a level of stability intended for public testing, they are likely to still include some bugs and incompatibilities which may frustrate you. It is not intended to use these releases for a live game.</p>
<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> Be certain to back up any critical user data before installing this update.</p>

<h2 class="border">Update Highlights</h2>

<p>The Version 9 API Development 2 update (V9d2) centered primarily around lighting and vision rendering improvements, the initial implementation of keybindings, improvements to audio video chat integration, and addressing a variety of concerns submitted by the FVTT development community.</p>
<h4>Lighting and Vision Accuracy and Efficiency</h4>
<p>As part of the implementation of the new Adaptive Lighting system, we wanted to tackle the complex problem of providing calculation of vision and lighting polygons in a way that was both more accurate and more efficient. In addition to working toward creation of some new algorithmic approaches to this problem, we were able to work with some subject matter experts within the community on this problem and the outcome is one we are extremely proud of. The new <code>ClockwiseSweepAlgorithm</code> which emerged from this work has shown a significant increase in performance, a reduction in issues where vision was not rendered accurately, a complete removal of cases where walls did not impede vision as intended, and enables scenes to be rendered at a comfortable FPS with a far greater number of walls and light sources than ever before. In short: Everything about the way lighting and vision is rendered is now more accurate and faster, with most calculations completing in less than a single millisecond.</p>
<h4>Audio Video Chat Integration Improvements</h4>
<p>There have been a number of lingering issues with A/V chat since we transitioned to the new webRTC impelementation through simple-peer in a previous version. As part of an ongoing effort to improve the overall state of A/V Chat Integration, we have resolved a number of bugs and added support for a few features. In addition to correcting some issues related to voice activation and display of user avatars, we completely redesigned the data passed internally for A/V settings and it now maintains information on the state of connected clients, including whether or not their microphone is muted, camera is disabled, or if they are currently speaking. Doing so lays the groundwork for extending A/V support in the future in meaningful ways. </p>
<h4>Keybinding Support</h4>
<p>The ability to rebind keys has been on our roadmap for some time, and given the benefit it would bring for community developers, the V9 API development cycle seemed the appropriate time to tackle it. As of V9d2, all core functions which had bound keys have been mapped to an all new API functionality for registering keybindings, and community developers may not only modify those keybindings, they may also create and register their own functions  through the new keybindings API. It should be made clear here that at this time this is an API only solution, but we do plan to provide a UX/UI implementation for rebinding hotkeys during the V9 User Testing phase.</p>

<h2 class="border">New Features</h2>
    <h3>Architecture and Infrastructure</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><code>Tile _alphaMap</code> has been updated to only compute when required, avoiding unnecessary work for underfoot tiles which do not require this data. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/5523" target="_blank">5523</a>)
        </li>
        <li>The PIXI Application environment has been configured to use the autoDensity option for assigning screenspace to address some potential edge cases where <code>Canvas#_onResize</code> might result in a non-integer screenspace. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6046" target="_blank">6046</a>)</li>
        <li>The PIXI Environment has been reconfigured to ensure that the preferred WebGL version is set to 2. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6028" target="_blank">6028</a>)</li>
        <li>Updated a number of dependency packages to their latest stable versions. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6102" target="_blank">6102</a>)</li>
        <li>Upgraded Electron to latest stable version 15.3.2 from previous Electron version 14. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6108" target="_blank">6108</a>)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Game Canvas</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The underlying Vision and Lighting system now uses a new <code>ClockwiseSweepAlgorithm</code> which is both more accurate and more efficient, resulting in major performance gains for rendering lighting and vision polygons. The <code>ClockwiseSweepAlgorithm</code> constructs a <code>PointSourcePolygon</code> using 2d geometry orientation tests (clockwise, counter-clockwise) rather than computing ray distances and angles for major performance gains in polygon construction. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/5891" target="_blank">5891</a>)</li>
        <li>Introduced a new approach for segmenting intersecting walls to prevent cases where overlapping walls would cause vision to be calculated incorrectly using the new <code>RadialSweepPolygon</code> or <code>ClockwiseSweepPolygon</code> implementations. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/5675" target="_blank">5675</a>)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Interface and Applications</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Audio/Video chat integration settings have been redesigned and now maintains a transient state of connected clients, their muted/hidden status, and whether they are currently speaking. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/3659" target="_blank">3659</a>)</li>
        <li>The "Custom Signaling Server" options have been removed from A/V configuration intertface as they were no longer used. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6045" target="_blank">6045</a>)</li>
        <li>It is now possible to change Scene background color, grid color, and grid opacity without re-drawing the entire canvas. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/4880" target="_blank">4880</a>)</li>
        <li>A new UI option allows users to create a combat that is not linked to a scene, allowing for GMs to conveniently create a combat which spans multiple scenes.(<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6050" target="_blank">6050</a>)</li>
        <li>The combat tracker now only re-renders in cases where specific relevant data attributes were changed.(<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/5017" target="_blank">5017</a>)</li>
        <li><code>CombatData#turn</code> is now nullable, and core combat handling no longer assumes that a turn is non-null, treating a null value as "no one's turn". <code>Combat#combatant</code> can now return null or undefined as a result. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/4956" target="_blank">4956</a>)</li>
        <li>The chat entry field now supports creation of dynamic links to Documents using drag and drop workflows, allowing convenient linking to specific actors, items, journal entries or otherwise. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6053" target="_blank">6053</a>)</li>
        <li>A new <code>/macro</code> chat command has been implemented which introduces ability to execute a macro. It accepts both <code>/macro {macro name}</code> and <code>/macro {hotbar number}</code> as parameters for locating a macro.(<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6011" target="_blank">6011</a>)</li>
        <li>The list of journal entries in the dropdown selector for Journal map notes is now alphabetically sorted. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6078" target="_blank">6078</a>)</li>
        <li>The Token Configuration window now allows decimals in the Elevation field. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6061" target="_blank">6061</a>)</li>
        <li>Addressed some small inconsistencies in the Controls Reference. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/5996" target="_blank">5996</a>)</li>
        <li>An additional 600 equipment and spell icons have been migrated from the dnd5e system folder to the icons folder for the core software. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6103" target="_blank">6103</a>)</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
<h2 class="border">API Improvements</h2>
    <h3>Architecture and Infrastructure</h3>
    <ul>

        <li><code>PIXI.settings.FILTER_RESOLUTION</code> has been reconfigured to use <code>canvas.app.renderer.resolution</code> by default. Filters which are constructed prior to canvasInit or which need a different resolution will require individual configuration. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/5892" target="_blank">5892</a>)</li>
        <li>The <code>WallConfig</code> class has been reconfigured to be a standard <code>DocumentSheet</code> subclass. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6101" target="_blank">6101</a>)</li>
        <li>Resolved an unused &#x60;name&#x60; variable in &#x60;PermissionControl.updateObject&#x60;. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6018" target="_blank">6018</a>)</li>
        <li>Corrected an invalid <code>this</code> reference in <code>Compendium#metadata#entity</code> does not have the correct &quot;this&quot; reference to obtain the &quot;type&quot; field. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6024" target="_blank">6024</a>)</li>
        <li><code>CompendiumCollection#updateAll</code> should now function as expected, allowing the updating of particular data values for all objects contained within a compendium pack. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6076" target="_blank">6076</a>)</li>
        
    </ul>

    <h3>The Game Canvas</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Several new classes and functions designed to support improved polygon computation have been introduced, including <code>ClockwiseSweepPolygon</code>, <code>PolygonVertex</code>, <code>PolygonEdge</code>, <code>CollisionResult</code>, and many more. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6021" target="_blank">6021</a>)</li>
        <li>The <code>screenDimension</code> updating logic has been refactored and now uses a centralized <code>Canvas#screenDimensions</code> array which can be used directly to define uniforms which need the renderer dimensions. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6080" target="_blank">6080</a>)</li>
        <li><code>ControlIcon#draw</code> now verifies whether a control icon has already been destroyed during scene teardown operations. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6055" target="_blank">6055</a>)</li>
        <li><code>Token.drawBars</code> is no longer called twice when updating a synthetic actor. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6086" target="_blank">6086</a>)</li>
        <li><code>ForegroundLayer#displayRoofs</code> will now return a boolean as expected. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6019" target="_blank">6019</a>)</li>
        <li>The <code>Canvas#getLayer</code> method has been deprecated and will be deleted in v10. It is not currently used by the core API. Callers of this method should instead use the known canvas layer references directly. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6079" target="_blank">6079</a>)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Interface and Applications</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The initial implementation of Customizable Keybinding Support is now available at an API only level, allowing community developers to rebind core keybinds or register their own keybindings directly through API functions. For more information please see: (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/2801" target="_blank">2801</a>)</li>
        <li>All core Keybindings have been remapped to use the new <code>game.keybindings</code> registration approach. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6000" target="_blank">6000</a>)</li>
        <li>Added a way to process native JavaScript Keyboard Events and execute matching registered Keybind Actions. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6001" target="_blank">6001</a>)</li>
        <li>Keyboard <code>handleMovement</code> has received a minor update to its handling logic. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6090" target="_blank">6090</a>)</li>
        <li>It is now possible to register sheets for every document type, allowing for a choice of sheets to be used at an individual document level in the same way as Actor and Item documents. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/4994" target="_blank">4994</a>)</li>
        <li>Resolved a number of cases where <code>Application#render</code> did not provide the expected return. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6026" target="_blank">6026</a>)</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h2 class="border">Documentation Improvements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A number of classes and methods have had their JSDoc strings updated to document the <code>options</code> object. Going forward the extended <code>@typedef</code> JSDoc string will be used to document additional options available to classes and methods. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/4993" target="_blank">4993</a>)</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div>
<h2 class="border">Localization Improvements</h2>
<ul>
    <li><code>i18n.localize</code> will now treat partial localization paths as an unmatched string and return the original key instead of returning an inner-object which has no string representation. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6095" target="_blank">6095</a>)</li>
    <li>Provided localization for a number of applications, sheets, and buttons which previously had non-localized titles. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6083" target="_blank">6083</a>)</li>

</div>
<div>
<h2 class="border">Bug Fixes</h2>
    <h3>Architecture and Infrastructure</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>To resolve an issue which would prevent launching a world during server-side migration and potentially result in serverside crashes, the <code>game.ready</code> flag is now set after a migration has completed. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6066" target="_blank">6066</a>)</li>
        <li>Corrected a compendium migration issue resulting from the <code>entity -> type</code> change which could cause Worlds to fail to load in v8 after migration to v9. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6060" target="_blank">6060</a>)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Documents and Data</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Passing a list of items to update a synthetic token actor no longer results in disparity between server and client side storage of the actor data. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/5988" target="_blank">5988</a>)</li>
        <li>Modifying owned items of an actor in a compendium no longer incorrectly displays those items as being stored within the compendium. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6062" target="_blank">6062</a>)</li>
        <li>Adding a new owned item to an actor with unlinked tokens no longer requires a refresh to update the unlinked token actors. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6075" target="_blank">6075</a>)</li>
        <li>Corrected a handling issue with drag and drop operations for Items embedded on Actors for unlinked tokens. This resolves an error which would occur in the specific case of dropping an embedded item onto an actor sheet from which the unlinked token originated. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6071" target="_blank">6071</a>)</li>
        <li>Importing card decks from compendium packs now functions as expected and no longer fails with error. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6035" target="_blank">6035</a>)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The Game Canvas</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In introducing the new lighting and vision rendering algorithms, resolved an issue which could cause vision rendering to discard some wall endpoints in very specific cases. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/5843" target="_blank">5843</a>)</li>
        <li>Terrain walls no longer incorrectly block vision in the specific case where multiple terrain walls share a single end point. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/5935" target="_blank">5935</a>)</li>
        <li>Resolved an issue where it was possible to see token Conditions and Condition Overlays even if they were obscured by scene Padding. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6030" target="_blank">6030</a>)</li>
        <li>Moving a webm token or tile no longer results in animation halting and the placeable disappearing. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6036" target="_blank">6036</a>)</li>
        <li>Panning operations at screen edges should now appropriately handle cases where the arrow-key based movement occurs within the width of the sidebar. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6063" target="_blank">6063</a>)</li>
        <li>The workflows for sight layer fog initialization and reloading have been reworked to function as expected regardless of the persisted fog state from the database. This resolves an issue where toggling fog exploration off for a scene would not correctly obscure current exploration progress. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6082" target="_blank">6082</a>)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Interface and Applications</h3>

        <li>Voice activation for video and audio chat now functions once more. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6038" target="_blank">6038</a>)</li>
        <li>Corrected an issue with compendium-based drop operations into Rollable Tables which had negative performance implications. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6042" target="_blank">6042</a>)</li>
        <li>Drag operations on menu items that have an active context menu no longer show the context menu in the dragged preview image. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/5986" target="_blank">5986</a>)</li>
        <li>Switching between encounters as a GM now updates the active encounter for players as expected. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6049" target="_blank">6049</a>)</li>
        <li>Corrected an issue where unconventional casing of file extensions could result in the FilePicker not showing those files. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6057" target="_blank">6057</a>)</li>
        <li>The document creation dialog will now correctly prompt for a destination folder if one or more folders exist. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6064" target="_blank">6064</a>)</li>
        <li>Addressed an edge case where pressing the Page Up key in any rich text entry field if you have text in that field would result in the entire UI shifting up and to the left. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6084" target="_blank">6084</a>)</li>
        <li>Resolved a permission error which could occur in cases where a user attempted to set the defeated condition on a combatent for systems which do not have a specified 'defeated' effect. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6089" target="_blank">6089</a>)</li>
        <li>Resolved an issue where dragging to resize a tile could result in a non-integer width and height which prevented future updates to a Tile through the Tile configuration sheet. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6092" target="_blank">6092</a>)</li>
        <li>The authors field for package data once again appears on package listings and on the <code>/setup</code> page. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/5983" target="_blank">5983</a>)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Other Changes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The <code>makeDefault</code> option for document sheet registration (such as  <code>Actors.registerSheet</code>) now uses the last registered competing 'default' as the default sheet. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/5997" target="_blank">5997</a>)</li>
        <li>Permissions for token actors should now correctly update when permissions are changed on the actor from which the token originated. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6022" target="_blank">6022</a>)</li>
        <li>Retreiving a compendium document should no longer incorrectly discard indexed properties. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6087" target="_blank">6087</a>)</li>

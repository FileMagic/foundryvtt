  <section id="update-overview">
	<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> Be certain to carefully back up any critical user data before installing this update.</p>
	<p>Just because several of the team are enjoying GenCon doesn't mean we can't get another updated release out for Version 10! This release on the Feature Testing channel focuses on refining the UX and UI, finalizing some key features and exterminating some of the lingering bugs found during the past two testing releases. Version 10 has focused bringing forward a new Tours system to provide more organic and natural feeling instruction on how to use Foundry VTT, Vision Modes to provide all new ways to experience scenes through the eyes of your Tokens, and the result of our Feature Prioritization Poll: Journals V2, enhancing the way gamemasters and their players can chronicle their adventures. We look forward to further refining the user experience with these features as we work toward closing out the testing phase and moving into the stable period for V10!</p>
	<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> Releases on the Testing channel have the potential to introduce bugs that may be disruptive to play. These features are close to a stable release - but likely to still include some bugs and incompatibilities which may frustrate you. While these releases are intended for testing by the average user, we do not recommend you use them yet in your long running campaigns. We instead ask you try them out in a new World or one-shot with no modules.</p>

	<h2 class="section-header border">Update Highlights</h2>
	<p>With stable looming on the horizon we have continued to squash bugs and polish up the user experience surrounding this update's new features. As such, the majority of work done during this release was to incorporate feedback and bug reports with the aim of making V10 the most satisfying experience possible for our users.</p>
	<h4>A Vision for the Canvas</h4>
	<p>This iteration brought a number of improvements and bug fixes for vision modes and the way certain aspects of the game canvas are displayed. We've scrubbed out some visual bugs with dragging tokens, further improved vision calculation accuracy and performance, and exposed even more API functionality for community devs to leverage in their wild canvas-related projects. We've made some tweaks to how the default Tremor Sense vision mode determines where the ground is, tweaked a few knobs on the appearance of some of the vision modes, and made some changes to some of the assumptions around light source behavior. We still have more to go, but we're nearly there!</p>
	<h4>Pages of Journal Improvements</h4>
	<p>This update sees lots of UI and UX fixes to the new Journals V2 feature set, and while we've got a bit more polish and shine to put on them, they are working better than ever. This update brought in fixes for visual display bugs, improved the way raw html is displayed, corrected permission issues, map note visibility, and added a few small quality of life features to make editing journals even better. This release further polishes features of the new Prose Mirror editor for Journals V2, and begins our aggressive campaign to sunset the use of TinyMCE.</p>
	<h4>Bugs for the Bug Throne</h4>
	<p>The team continues tirelessly hunting down bugs with guidance from you, our unfailingly dedicated and keen-eyed community, and this update definitely brings the heat, with the majority of the following patch notes being dedicated to the squishing of bugs both big and small throughout the software. This ensures that our users and community developers alike will have fewer creepy crawlies to contend with when the software finally goes stable in the not so distant future. A big thanks once again to everyone in the community helping us out by testing and reporting bugs, by doing your part you're ensuring our coders are able to push back the insect menace on the front lines!</p>
	<p>All in all the team is very excited to get V10 Stable into the community's hands, and with this update we are closer than ever!</p>

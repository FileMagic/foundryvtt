<h2 class="border">Update Highlights</h2>

<p>As the second release in our Feature Testing phase for Version 9, this update primarily focused on implementing fixes to bugs based on feedback from the intrepid parts of the community willing to test our previous build. As such there aren't a whole lot of features to highlight or dicuss. </p>
<h4>Next Step for Keybindings</h4>
<p>Having corrected some flaws in the keybinding system we're still working toward making the user experience of setting new key bindings comfortable. This update brings the first UI implementation, in the form of a read-only display of keybindings that you have configured via the API. Our next iteration will feature ability to change keybindings via this menu, but for now we chose to focus on getting a preliminary display up for the user instead. Please note: it is not within the scope of V9 to allow users to rebind mouse button clicks, as this would require far more significant changes to the infrastructure for our controls.</p>
<h4>Continued Canvas Improvements</h4>
<p>As a large part of the focus for V9 has centered around lighting and vision rendering, we continue to optimize the numerous refactors we've made. While the performance gains for many of the changes made in today's update are minor, the continued refinements reduce technical debt overall and should help to make V9 one of the most performant releases to date. In addition to making changes to a number of background tasks, we have also taken the time to implement a setting for Performance Mode (Low, Medium, High, and Maximum) which allows users to fine-tune some ways the canvas handles rendering. If you do not have a Performance Mode set when you first join a game, it will automatically base your performance mode on your detected hardware. Those with more substantial gaming computers with dedicated GPUs should feel comfortable setting this to maximum.</p>
<h4>New User Experience Improvements</h4>
<p>Some of you may have noticed that we have a new label for issues on gitlab: NUE. These issues are ones we've identified as potential pain points where new users struggle to adapt to the software or where improvements could generally be made to streamline the learning curve. This release brings the first in a series of updates we will be working toward over time in order to make the software more approachable for new users. We have changed the behaviour of the setup menu a little for fresh installations, so that new users are prompted to install a Game System before they get started trying to create a World.</p>

<h2 class="border">New Features</h2>
    <h3>The Game Canvas</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The Foreground layer's occlusion mask texture is now only rendered when it is necessary to do so (when roof or radial overhead tiles are present). (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6117" target="_blank">6117</a>)</li>
        <li>Assign a default performance mode for clients which do not have a saved setting based on the attributes of the detected GPU. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6208" target="_blank">6208</a>)</li>
        <li>The lighting illumination container now uses a <code>BlurFilter</code> instead of an <code>>AlphaFilter</code> for high or maximum performance modes to ensure that borders of vision and light sources blend smoothly. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6145" target="_blank">6145</a>)</li>
        xx <li>When using the low performance mode, disable use of render textures for lighting and vision rendering. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6207" target="_blank">6207</a>)</li>
        <li>Some prototype code for the lighting layer delimiter display which was intended for internal use only has been removed. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6205" target="_blank">6205</a>)</li>
        <li>The previous restriction on maximum vision radius has been removed as this is now determined by the bounds of the canvas. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6218" target="_blank">6218</a>)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Interface and Applications</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A basic UI for managing keybinds has been added in preparation of allowing users to rebind keys. At present, this UI is read-only, setting new keybinds still requires use of the keybinds API. Please note: rebinding mouse click functions is not supported and will not be supported in V9. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6040" target="_blank">6040</a>) and (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6094" target="_blank">6094</a>)</li>

        <li>The Reset Advanced Options button has been moved and now only appears on the advanced lighting options tab when configuring light sources. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6217" target="_blank">6217</a>)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Other Changes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>To make it more clear for new users, a freshly installed Foundry VTT will now display a prompt recommending installing a game system and disables the Worlds tab until a game system is installed. (<a href="https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6183" target="_blank">6183</a>)</li>
    </ul>

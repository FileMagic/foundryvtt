<section id="update-overview">
    <p>This update brings a wide range of improvements and new features to Foundry VTT, including the addition of snow and rain weather effects, improved wall sense types, folder organization in Compendium packs, and more. Additionally, we&#x27;ve made some breaking changes to the Data Model API which developers should be aware of. We recommend checking out the full list of changes below for a detailed breakdown of what was changed in this update!</p>
    <p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> Updates on the Prototype channel provide the implementation of major new features which are likely to introduce unforeseen bugs, breakages to existing game systems or modules, or other problems which will be disruptive to the usage of the software. Do not install this update unless you are doing so for the specific purposes of testing, it is not intended for use in 'live game' scenarios. The purpose of Prototype builds are to allow new experimental features to be tested and to help developers to begin the process of updating packages which are impacted by these changes. If you choose to update to this version you expose yourself to serious risk of having a bad experience. Please take this warning to heart.</p>

<section id="update-themes">
    <h2 class="border">Update Highlights</h2>
    <h3>New Setup and World Login Screens</h3>
    <p>As part of an ongoing effort streamline the UX and UI of Foundry VTT, V11P2 introduces our brand-new UI for the setup and world login pages. The new setup screen brings new functionality, a more convenient layout, responsive design, a 'news' section, and lays the groundwork for a future where we might be able to offer additional UI themes for our users (looking at you, light-mode fans).</p>
    <p>In addition, we have moved many of the buttons that were once repeated on individual menu items into a simple context menu. We also added a prompt to notify you that you should set an administrator password, in the event you have not. Any warnings or errors detected when launching Foundry VTT are now conveniently organized into an error log, which you can view by clicking the "Warnings" button in the top-right corner, just next to the new configuration button.</p>
    <p>The World Login page has also gotten an style update, offering the option for both a traditional "default" display, showcasing game details and a robust world description— or a more simplified "minimal" option which only displays an option to login.</p>
    <p>We're very pleased with the direction that the new UI design has taken, and are excited to finally show it off to the community— but we also know there are still changes we need to bring, so please be considerate with any criticism you may have. We hope you'll all find it as aesthetically pleasing as we do!</p>

    <h3>Get Organized with Compendium Folders</h3>
    <p>Compendium Packs can now contain Folders! This long-awaited feature makes it possible to import and export Folders between your World and a Compendium. You can search, collapse, and expand Compendium Folders just like in the normal sidebar. As an added bonus, we've also increased the max folder depth from 3 to 4!</p>

    <h3>Opt-In Statistics</h3>
    <p>We have always been a very privacy-focused company when it comes to our users and their data, so we'd like to take this moment to reassure everyone that isn't significantly changing. We understand this is a very, very thorny topic, so we aren't making any changes without looking really closely at how it might impact our community.</p>
    <p>We want you to know that we respect your data and your privacy.</p>
    <p>With the launch of Version 11, users will be prompted at first launch to consider whether they'd like to opt-in to send us anonymous usage statistics. If enabled, Foundry VTT software will periodically send anonymized data to us for our own use. This can be toggled off from the setup configuration menu at any time, and when disabled the software will not send us any data that it has gathered.</p>
    <p>In support of these changes we have updated our EULA to version 11.293.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>How do these statistics help?</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>There are a few ways this benefits us:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>We could better focus our internal testing to accommodate game systems and modules which are more popular within the community.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>We would be able to make informed decisions about software compatibility development.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>We could answer questions from the community and our publishing partners about which game systems are most popular on our service.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>We could give our community developers insight into popularity of their modules.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are a few other ways, but this is probably a comprehensive enough list for now. The reality is that gathering anonymous usage statistics such as</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Will I be able to see what data is going to be sent?</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Yes! the usage statistics will be stored locally in a JSON file which can be viewed by the server host. The file is stored at <code>{User Data}/Logs/diagnostics.json</code>. This step was taken intentionally to allow for transparency on what data we're gathering. Even when disabled, you can access this file to see what data we would send if you were to enable it.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Is the privacy policy going to be updated?</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>It already has! We added a clause explaining what we intend to use this data for, and what data we'll be gathering. You can view it here: [LINK TO PRIVACY POLICY]</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Will this ever become opt-out, or mandatory?</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>We don't ever want to force our users to report statistics about their hosted servers. We chose to make this opt-in after careful consideration of what it would mean to our community, and as a team we really don't like the idea of mandatory gathering of data.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Will this affect performance?</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>As this operation is a very minimal data-writing operation, it shouldn't have any impact on performance.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Are you going to sell this data to other companies?</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Absolutely not. We don't think of our community members as commodities.</p>
    <p>We hope that you will all enable these statistics to benefit our development efforts, but we understand completely if you choose not to! As always, what you choose to do with your Foundry VTT server is your decision!</p>

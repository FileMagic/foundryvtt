# Foundry Virtual Tabletop 
<img align="right" src="https://foundryvtt.com/static/assets/icons/fvtt.png" width="150px">This repository serves as the catchpen for tracking planned features, feature requests, bugs and other issues for the [Foundry Virtual Tabletop](https://foundryvtt.com]) software. 

Foundry Virtual Tabletop provides an innovative online role-playing experience. The software supports Windows, Mac, and Linux and allows you to self-host a game server that players connect to for free directly through a web browser.

## Issue Tracker 
Our issue tracker provides a simple overview and project management tools for outlining planned work for the core software, and allows our users to easily keep up to date on how development is proceeding. More detailed than a simple roadmap, users can filter specific types of issues through GitHub labels, or use our project views to see work effort on particular milestones.

The Foundry VTT Development team makes use of GitHub Projects to organize and scope the planned work we intend to do for each phase of a new software version. Through use of specific filters and project boards our users can easily keep up to date:

### [Current Projects](https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/projects?query=is%3Aopen)
Our Project Boards are generally the best way to see everything we're planning to do at the scale of a full software version. If you want to see everything we are planning across the whole version of the software this is where to look.

### [Current Milestones](https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/milestones)
We use Milestones to compartmentalize the section of a version we we are actively working on. Each milestone displays what work was done in a particular release, rather than a whole version.

### [Labels](https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/labels)
Labels are an efficient way to check whether or not someone has already filed a bug report or feature request you may wish to file. In addition, they can be used to browse for issues related to particular parts of the software.

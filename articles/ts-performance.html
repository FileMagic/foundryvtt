<h2 class="border">Overview</h2>
<p>This article explains some common reasons for poor performance in Foundry VTT, such as a low framerate or delayed actions, and the steps required to resolve those issues. Each case can be different, so these steps are not a one-size-fits-all solution and cover the client side settings, browser settings, and even network or module settings that can help correct for performance issues.</p>
<h2 class="border">Before You Begin</h2>
<p>Before you proceed with troubleshooting, it's best to determine if your performance issues relate to your hardware or network issues. Foundry Virtual Tabletop relies on client-side rendering for graphical elements, which means each user (player, GM, or otherwise) should meet the @Article[requirements].</p>

<h2 class="border" id="framerate">Framerate Issues</h2>
<p>The hosted Foundry VTT server only sends data to clients and does not handle rendering for graphics or other lighting. Each user's computer, whether a player or a GM, renders all graphics based on client-side settings. Ensuring that hardware acceleration is enabled, optimizing your graphical settings for your hardware, and using less walls and lights on Scenes can all help improve performance.</p> 
<h3>Hardware Acceleration</h3>
<p>Framerate issues for Foundry VTT most commonly result from disabled Hardware Acceleration. Foundry VTT requires hardware Acceleration and use of the client's graphics processing unit (GPU) to render its visuals, so if hardware acceleration is disabled or Foundry VTT cannot access the GPU, poor framerates and degraded performance are the immediate result. The steps to enable hardware acceleration are outlined below, including special steps to take on Windows.</p>

        <p>This process can be somewhat more tricky depending on OS. For MacOS or Linux it requires running the program via terminal. For windows, it requires creating or modifying a shortcut to the Foundry VTT executable.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>MacOS: Open a terminal and enter <code>open -a FoundryVTT --args ignore-gpu-blocklist</code> </li>
            <li>Linux: Open a terminal in your Foundry VTT installation directory and enter <code>./foundryvtt --ignore-gpu-blocklist</code></li>

        <p>Enabling Hardware Acceleration in Windows requires several steps. They are detailed below</p>
        <ol>
                <li>Navigate to to your Foundry VTT installation folder.</li>
                <li>Right click on 'foundryvtt.exe', and click 'Create Shortcut.'</li>
                <li>click the shortcut and select 'Properties.'</li>
                <li>In the 'Target' field, add a space at the end, outside the quotes, and enter <code>--ignore-gpu-blocklist</code>. The field should look similar to <code>"C:\...\FoundryVTT.exe" --ignore-gpu-blocklist</code>, where "..." is the path to your Foundry VTT installation folder. It is important that the addition of the launch flag is placed outside of the quotes, as if not it will not work. </li>
                <li>Press 'OK', and then use this shortcut to launch Foundry VTT from now on.</li>

<h3>Optimize Settings for Performance</h3>
    <p>Foundry Virtual Tabletop attempts to detect the best performance options for your hardware when you join a world. If these settings were based on misdetected information, you can modify these settings from <i class="fas fa-cogs"> </i> Configure Settings .</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pixel Ratio Resolution Scaling</strong> - For computers with very large monitors with high pixel density, such as Macs with Retina displays, disabling this may result in drastically improved performance at a cost of visual quality.</li>
            <li><strong>Performance Mode</strong> - Controls several optimization features. If you expereince performance issues while set to High or Maximum performance, changing this setting to Low or Medium may result in improved performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Maximum Framerate</strong> - If you are using a low-end computer, changing this to 30 FPS or less may reduce the amount of strain on your GPU. </li>
            <li><strong>Token Drag Vision</strong> - Disable this if you experience poor performance when moving Tokens with vision.</li>
            <li><strong>Light Source Animation</strong> - Disable this if you experience poor performance in scenes with animated Lights.</li>
        </ul> 
<h3>Excessive Lighting, Walling, or Animations</header>
    <p>Too many lights, walls, or animations on a Scene can severely impact performance. If performance improves on an empty scene or one with less lights, walls, or light animations, then this is likely the cause of the performance issues. @Article[content-creation-guide] has instructions on laying walls and lights with better performance in mind. As a general rule, try not to exceed 500 walls or 50 lights per Scene. This should help keep your Scenes friendly for even the most low-performance computers. </p>
<h2 class="border" id="network">Network Issues</h2>
<p>Slow response times in data transfer typically result from a slow or degraded network connection, but in rare cases can result from overuse of Add-on Modules. If it takes a long time to load the World when a player logs onto Foundry VTT, excess sidebar data and asset sizes are the most common culprit.</p>
    <h3>Slow Host Internet</header>
        <p>Foundry VTT requires the hosting computer to have at least 12 Mbps upload speed, and players at least 6 Mbps download speed. You can verify your upload or download speeds using a speedtest website such as <a href="https://speedtest.net" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Speedtest.net</a>. If your upload speed is less than 12 Mbps, self-hosting Foundry VTT will prove difficult. @Article[hosting] lists both free and paid alternatives to self-hosting that may be available to you.</p>
<h3>Module Related Issues</h3>
<p>While Add-on Modules are a popular feature of Foundry VTT, module conflicts or overuse can cause performance issues. The easiest way to determine if modules are the culrpit is to disable them all by launching your world in safe configuration. For instructions on how to do this, see @Article[launch-safe-configuration]. If Foundry VTT begins working normally, it's most likely that one or more modules are the source of your frustration.</p>
<section class="collapsible">
    <header class="collapsible-header">Identifying the Responsible Module</header>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
        <p>Finding the module at fault for your performance issues may seem like a daunting task if you have dozens or hundreds of modules. Fortunately there's a quick method to narrow down the offending module compared to enabling and disabling one by one. You will divide your modules into two groups, and then further divide these groups in half depending on if the issue returns or not.</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Enable half of your modules.</li>
        <li>If the performance issue returns: the module at fault is in this group. Enable half of this group, and check again.</li> 
        <li>If the performance issue does not return: the module at fault is in the other group of modules. Enable that group and check again.</li>
       </ul> 
       <p>Repeat this process, continually subdividing your group of modules until only one module remains. This will be the module at fault.</p>

<h3>Excessive "World Level" Data</h3>
<p>Any Documents which you actively store in the sidebar as readily accessible, including all of the Scenes, Actors, Items, Journals, and more, are all sent to each device that logs into the World when they connect. If your world contains hundreds or thousands of Documents, it will cause significant loading delays. We strongly recommend keeping whatever creatures, items, and data not needed for your current session (or next few sessions) in Compendium Packs. For more information on compendia and how to use them, see @Article[compendium].</p>
<h3>Large File Sizes</h3>
<p>Images such as the Scene background, foreground, token images and tiles are all sent to each player when a Scene is activated. Large image file sizes greatly increase the amount of data that must be sent and thus increase loading itmes. Wherever possible, use compressed image formats like WebP or WebM for Scene and Tile images. WebP images at 80-90% compression tend to produce low filesize images without sacrificing image quality in a noticeable way.</p>
<h3>Excessive Chat Messages</h3>
<p>The Foundry VTT chat log can grow pretty large over several sessions and may result in network performance issues. You can backup the current chat log by clicking <i class="fas fa-save"></i> which will export it as a simple text file for later reference. After which, you can click the <i class="fas fa-trash"></i> to clear the chat log of all previous messages, further reducing the amount of data that must be loaded for users when they connect. </p>

<p>This article covers common reasons for Foundry VTT to report your connection as closed or players failing to connect. Foundry VTT sends data back and forth between your computer and your players' computers. Firewalls, antivirus software, misconfigured network settings, or even technology used by your internet service provider (ISP) can all interfere with this.</p> 

<h2 class="border">Before You Begin</h2>
<p>Firewalls, antivirus software, network settings, and use of virtual private networks (VPNs) are all common reasons for a closed connection. Fortunately all of these are easy to check for and correct before continuing to the more advanced steps of this guide.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Firewall: Check that your firewall is set to allow incoming and outgoing connections on port 30000. If you're using Windows' built-in firewall, Windows Defender, you can add a rule following the directions in the <a href="/article/port-forwarding/">Port Forwarding</a> article. If you are using a 3rd party firewall or one that comes as part of an antivirus package, you will need to consult their documentation for allowing Foundry VTT through it.</li>
    <li>Virtual Private Network (VPN) Use: If you have a VPN installed, confirm that it's disabled. Most VPNs do not allow port forwarding through their services. Furthermore, they function as a black box when trying to determine the cause of a closed connection.</li>
    <li>Network Configuration on Windows: Check that your network profile in Windows is set to 'Private.'</li>
</ul>

    <header class="collapsible-header">Check or Change Windows Network Designation</header>
        <div class="collapsible-content"> 
            <p>Windows 10 designates networks as either Private or Public networks. If a network is set to Public, Windows restricts incoming connections. A Private designated network will allow incoming connections with a valid firewall rule. As such Foundry VTT requires your network be set to Private. To check or change your network designation:</p>
        <ol>   
            <li>Press your Windows key, type "Network Status", and press enter.</li>
            <li>Click the 'Properties' button under the network you're currently using.</li>
            <li>Under 'Network Profile,' ensure that your network is set to 'Private.'</li>
            <li>If your network was set to 'Public' before, open Foundry VTT and launch your world.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If your world still reports a closed connection or players are unable to connect, proceed to either "Connections Worked Before Without".</p>
        </div>

<h2 class="border">Connections Worked Without Port Forwarding</h2>
<p>If you did not need to set up a port forwarding rule for your players to connect, then Foundry VTT successfully used Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) to handle this step for you. Since then your router may have changed your computer's local IP address without updating the UPnP rule. To clear the old rule and create a new one, you will need to give your router a cold reboot.</p>
<section class="collapsible">
    <header class="collapsible-header">Clear Router's UPnP Cache With a Cold Reboot</header>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
    <ol>
     <li>Close out of Foundry VTT and locate the power cable on your router.</li>
     <li>Unplug your router's power cable for 30 seconds. This will clear the existing UPnP rules without affecting other network settings.</li>
     <li>Plug your router back in and allow it to finish its startup process.</li>
     <li>Launch Foundry VTT, navigate to the Settings page, and ensure that "Use UPnP" is checked.</li>
     <li>Launch your world and open the Invitation Links window to check if your connection is open. It may take a minute or two for the rule to finish setting up.</li> 
    </ol>
    </div>
</section>

<p>If your connection does not open after a couple minutes, you may need to manually set up a port forwarding rule. The <a href="/article/port-forwarding/">Port Forwarding</a> article contains instructions for setting up a port forwarding rule for Foundry VTT.</p>


<h2 class="border">Connections Required a Port Forwarding Rule</h2>
<p>You may recall when you set up your port forwarding rule that your computer has a local IP address assigned by your router. Most routers will change these addresses without warning, and without updating old rules. Thus the most frequent cause of your connection being closed is that your computer's local IP address was changed. </p>

        <div class="collapsible-content">  
            <h4>Determine Your Local IP Address</h4>
            <ul>
            <li>Windows: Open a command prompt by pressing your Windows key and entering "cmd". Enter <code>ipconfig</code>. The entry next to 'IPv4 Address' is your device's local IP address.</li>
            <li>MacOS: Open a terminal window. If you are on a wireless network, enter <code>ipconfig getifaddr en0</code>. If you connect to your network with a physical cable, use the command <code>ipconfig getifaddr en1</code>.</li>
            <li>Linux: Open a terminal window and enter <code>hostname -l</code> to display your local IP address.</li> 
            </ul>               
        <h4>Update Port Forwarding Rule</h4>
        <p>Access your router following the steps listed in the <a href="/article/port-forwarding/">Port Forwarding</a> article and navigate to your port forwarding rule. Change the destination or target address to your comuter's new local IP address. Check to see if Foundry VTT reports your connection as 'Closed." </p>

<h2 class="border">My Connection is Still Closed</h2>
<p>If your connection is still closed, there are several possible reasons. ISP software, such as Xfinity's Advanced Security, may be blocking connections. Your ISP may also use technology that interferes with port forwarding.</p>
<h3>Comcast/Xfinity Advanced Security</h3>
If you are an Xfinity customer, your ISP deploys a tool known as Advanced Security. When enabled, this blocks incoming connections even if you've set up a valid port forwarding rule. More information can be found on the Xfinity website <a href="https://www.xfinity.com/support/articles/using-xfinity-xfi-advanced-security">here</a>.
<h3>CGNAT and DS-Lite Infrastructure</h3>
<p>Carrier Grade Network Address Translation (CGNAT) and Dual-Stack Lite (DS-Lite) are two common technologies used by ISPs around the world that effectively act as multiple, inaccessible routers in front of your own. If this is the case, you will not be able to self-host unless your ISP is willing and able to take you off that technology. The <a href="/article/hosting/">Hosting Options Guide</a> contains information on your other hosting options.</p>
<p>Further troubleshooting, including checking for the presence of CGNAT or DS-Lite, requires direct assistance.

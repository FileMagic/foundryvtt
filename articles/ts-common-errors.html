<!-- 

General, overall: do a sweep through the messages and any ones that are just redundant with the error message try to reframe it to use simpler language, for example Canvas Drawing Failed, you wrote "Something, usually a Module or Game System, is preventing Foundry VTT from building the game canvas." I'd try for something like "Something, usual a Module or Game System is preventing Foundry VTT from rendering your scene. This usually occurs as a result of invalid data or a module bug."

<!-- Overview -->
<h2 class="border">Overview</h2>
<p>This article covers the most common errors you may encounter when using Foundry Virtual Tabletop. Many errors are resolved with just one or two steps. If you encounter an error not listed here, you may require direct assistance. Information for this can be found at the end of the article.</p>

<!-- Before you Begin -->
<h2 class="border">Before You Begin</h2>
<p>Foundry VTT displays most errors as a banner at the top of the screen as well as in the developer console. Some errors, however, won't be shown here, but instead just in the console. For this reason we suggest you check the console for errors when something fails to work.</p> 
<ul>
    <li><strong>Chrome/Edge:</strong> Press 'F12' or 'Ctrl + Shift + J' on Windows, or 'Opt + Cmd + J' on MacOS .</li>
    <li><strong>Firefox:</strong> Press 'F12' or 'Ctrl + Shift + I' on Windows, or 'Opt + Cmd + I' on MacOS.</li>
</ul>
In both cases, check that the 'Console' tab has been selected.
<h3>Errors vs Warnings</h3>
<p>Foundry VTT may show both warnings and errors. Warnings indicate that something is being done incorrectly. Most warnings thus are specific to Game System and Add-on Module developers and can be safely ignored. Errors however indicate that something has failed to work properly. This article covers several warnings that are relevant to end users, but otherwise focuses on errors.</p>
<p class="note error">This is an Error Message. Note the encircled '!' and red background color. Errors will appear as red text in the developer console.</p>
<p class="note warning">This is a Warning Message. Note the triangle symobl at the left and yellow background color.</p>

<p>Foundry VTT records errors and other messages in its log files, <code>error.log</code> and <code>debug.log</code>. These files are located in the Logs folder within your User Data directory (FoundryVTT/Logs). To check for recent errors, open <code>error.log</code> with a text editor or IDE such as Visual Studio Code and scroll to the last few lines. These will be the latest errors to occur while running Foundry VTT.</p>

<h2 class="border">Setup Screen Errors</h2>
<p>The following errors may display when Foundry VTT starts or before launching a world.</p>
<!-- Critical Errors Encountered with X Packages -->

        <div class="collapsible-content">  
            <ul>
                <li><b>Cause:</b> One or more installed modules are not updated for your current version of Foundry VTT.</li>
                <li><b>Solution:</b> Update all modules on the Add-On Modules screen. If the error continues to show, open the developer console and note which modules are still being listed. Then uninstall those modules. Some modules may need to be manually removed.Navigate to your User Data directory, open the "modules" directory, and delete the folder matching the name of the module.</li>

            </ul>
            <h4>Windows</h4>
           <ol>
            <li>Navigate to the 'Configuration' page and copy the path next to 'User Data Path.'</li>
            <li>Close out of Foundry VTT.</li>
            <li>Open PowerShell as an Administrator by pressing your Windows key, typing in "PowerShell", and selecting 'Run As Administrator.'</li>
            <li>Navigate to your user data directory by entering <code>cd &lt;user data path&gt;</code>, pasting in your copied user data path in place of <code>&lt;user data path&gt;</code>.</li>

                <li><b>Solution:</b> Sometimes waiting a few minutes and trying again will work if the cause was a hosting issue. Otherwise, we suggest you reach out to the module author for assistance. In the module's listing on the the Add-on Modules screen, check for an <strong>Author</strong> or <strong>URL</strong> link. Usually these will take you to a page where you can get in contact with the module's author.</li>

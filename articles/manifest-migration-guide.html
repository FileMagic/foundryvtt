<p>We have overhauled the Manifest definition to reduce user errors and allow for more powerful definitions. With the new <code>relationships</code> field, we have a powerful framework for future relationship types.</p>
<h2 class="border" id="deprecation-period">Deprecation Period: V13</h2>
<p>The new Version 10 manifest represents a slight restructuring of the existing manifest fields, including changes to support the new relationships schema.</p>
<p>These deprecation period for these changes will last until V13.</p>
<h2 class="border">Automated Migration API</h2>
<p>Looking to migrate quickly and automatically? While on the Setup page, you can execute an API in console to automatically write the migrated Manifest to disk, then commit it.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">// Only valid on Setup screen

// You use a multi-track release workflow that has a v10-only track and want to commit to /v10/manifest.json
game.modules.get("1000-fish").migrateManifest();

// You use a single-track release workflow and want to commit to /latest/manifest.json
game.modules.get("1000-fish").migrateManifest({v9Compatible: true});
</code></pre>
<h2 class="border" id="migration-1-name-to-id">Migration 1: name to id</h2>
<p>A common user mistake was to treat the <code>name</code> field as a human-readable field, rather than as a unique machine-readable one. We have clarified this by renaming it <code>id</code>.</p>

<h2 class="border" id="migration-2-compatibility">Migration 2: compatibility</h2>
<p>The current way of denoting compatibility was fairly mixed - core compatibility used <code>minimumCoreVersion</code> and <code>compatibleCoreVersion</code>, and we supported an unclear <code>minimumSystemVersion</code> as well for Packages that relied on a single System.</p>
<p>We have consolidated this concept into a single <code>Compatibility</code> field that is used top level for denoting Core compatibility, and in <code>relationships.systems</code> (more on that later) for denoting related Package compatibility. While we were here, we also added a <code>maximum</code></p>
<ul>
<li><code>minimum</code>: The Package will not function before this version</li>
<li><code>verified</code>: Verified compatible up to this version</li>
<li><code>maximum</code>: The Package will not function after this version</li>
</ul>
<p>As a refresher, when defining Core compatibility, the following forms are valid:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generation: A single digit indicates "entire generation", such as <code>9</code>. "I am compatible with all of generation 9"</li>
<li>Build: A double indicates "specific build", such as <code>9.120</code>. "I am compatible up to build 9.120"</li>
</ul>

<p>Our previous <code>dependencies</code> field is treated as a "hard dependency", but we want to expand in the future to things like optional dependencies. The new <code>relationships</code> field offers us a framework to do this, and offered us a chance to improve how we define System relationships as well.</p>
<p>While we were doing this, we took advantage of the new <code>Compatibility</code> field to add more clarity to how a Package relates to another Package.</p>

<h3 id="how-package-relationships-install">How Package Relationships install</h3>
<p>When a Package is installed, Foundry checks to see if the related Packages are installed. If they are not installed:</p>
<ul>
<li>A lookup is done on the <code>type</code> and <code>id</code> to find that Package listing, and it is installed.</li>
<li>If the Package does not exist in the listing, then the <code>manifest</code> field is used to install the Package.</li>
<li>As of V10, a Package will only install if the `compatibility` of the dependency is met.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="border" id="staying-v9-compatible">Staying V9 Compatible</h2>
<p>A Package manifest is a bit different than code when migrating - if your Package exists in V9, then the manifest that is located at the <code>manifest</code> field for a V9 package, such as <code>/latest/manifest.json</code>, will need to retain V9 compatibility.</p>
<p>The easiest way to do this is to just do nothing - V10 will automigrate this format, then when you make a V11 package you can swap to the V10 format by default.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can leave behind the critical fields needed by V9 - <code>name</code> and, if your package is only compatible in V10, <code>minimumCoreVersion</code></p>

<!-- Module or Systems Won't Update  -->
<section class="collapsible">
    <header class="collapsible-header">My Modules or Game Systems Won't Update</header>
        <div class="collapsible-content">  
            <p>There are a few reasons that would prevent Add-on Modules or Game Systems from updating:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Host Issues:</strong> Modules and Game Systems are hosted by various providers. If a provider is facing technical issues or heavy traffic, it may refuse your connection. Try waiting a few minutes and trying again. If you're using a VPN, try disabling it and trying again.</li>
                <li><strong>Bad Manifest:</strong> This is an issue with one of the module or system's files. We suggest reaching out to the author of the Module or Game System for assistance.</li>
                <li><strong>No Update Available for Your Version of Foundry VTT:</strong> If a module or system author has only created updates for a newer major version of Foundry VTT, then it will fail to update. The module or system will still work the same as before. If you wish to upgrade Foundry VTT and use the latest module release, <strong>first back up your User Data</strong> following the steps at @Article[user-data-backup].</li>
                <li><strong>Permissions Issue:</strong> If an error starting with "EPERM" appeared when you tried to update, you will need to change the permissions level of your User Data folder. This process depends on your operating system. A step-by-step guide is available in @Article[ts-common-errors].</li>
            </ul>
                </div>

<section class="collapsible">
    <header class="collapsible-header">My World Won't Launch</header>
        <div class="collapsible-content">  
            <p>Worlds not launching typically come down to database or permissions errors. A red error banner should appear at the top of the screen indicating what the specific error is. @Article[ts-common-errors] explains these errors and their solutions in more detail.</p> 
           </div>
</section>


<h2 class="border">Connection Issues</h2>
<p>Foundry VTT needs a clear path to accept incoming connections. A closed connection or players being unable to connect is usually due to something preventing traffic from reaching Foundry VTT on your computer. Once you've determined the possible source, the article @Article[ts-connection-closed] contains further instructions on identifying and resolving network related issues.</p>
<section class="collapsible">
    <header class="collapsible-header">Determine Source of Connection Issues</header>
        <div class="collapsible-content">
            <h4>Local Connectivity Test</h4> 
            <p>Using another device on the same network as your computer, such as a laptop or phone on WiFi, attempt to connect to Foundry VTT using the <b>Local Network</b> invitation link. If Foundry VTT does not load, something on your computer is preventing incoming connections. Typically this happens if you have a firewall active without an exception for Foundry VTT, antivirus software, or network settings on Windows. See @Article[port-forwarding] for more information on creating a firewall rule. If you are using antivirus software, temporarily disable it and try connecting again. If you're able to connect, refer to its documentation for steps to add an exception for Foundry VTT.</p>
            <h4>Local Connections Work</h4>
            <p>If Foundry VTT loads with the local connectivity test but reports your connection is closed, or your players are still unable to connect, then the issue will either be related to port forwarding or ISP technology known as CGNAT. See @Article[port-forwarding] for instructions on how to set up port forwarding and check that existing rules are working properly. @Article[ts-connection-closed] contains further instructions on troubleshooting a closed connection, including testing for CGNAT.</p> 
            <h4>I'm Using a VPN</h4>
            <p>VPNs add extra layers of routers and servers between you and your players. Unfortunately they also act as black boxes that are inaccessible for troubleshooting. We advise disabling your VPN when hosting Foundry Virtual Tabletop.</p>

<h2 class="border">General Troubleshooting Steps</h2>
<p>Troubleshooting other issues is a fairly straightforward process. These include disabling all modules, checking the console for errors, and narrowing down possible causes for the issue.</p>
<p>Disable all modules by launching your world in safe configuration. @Article[launch-safe-configuration] contains the steps for this process. If this fixes the problem, the issue was module related. Re-enable your modules in small batches, checking each time if the issue persists, to quickly determine the module at fault. The developer console may indicate which module is at fault too.
<h3>My Issue Is Still There After Disabling Modules</h3>
<p>The next step is to check the developer console for error messages. This involves opening your browser's Developer Tools, navigating to its Console tab, and then looking for messages in red text. Warnings in yellow can usually be ignored, most issues will show as errors. Checking for errors will help guide troubleshooting and identify the culprit. @Article[ts-common-errors] contains a list of the most common errors you may see, as well as steps to resolve them.
<ul>
    <li><strong>Chrome/Edge:</strong> Press 'F12' or 'Ctrl + Shift + J' on Windows, or 'Opt + Cmd + J' on MacOS .</li>
    <li><strong>Firefox:</strong> Press 'F12' or 'Ctrl + Shift + I' on Windows, or 'Opt + Cmd + I' on MacOS.</li>
</ul>

<section class="collapsible">
    <header class="collapsible-header">Warnings vs Errors</header>
        <div class="collapsible-content">  
            <p>Foundry VTT may show both warnings and errors. Warnings indicate that something is being done incorrectly. Most warnings thus are specific to Game System and Add-on Module developers and can be safely ignored. Errors however indicate that something has failed to work properly. This article covers several warnings that are relevant to end users, but otherwise focuses on errors.</p>
<p class="note error">This is an Error Message. Note the encircled '!' and red background color. Errors will appear as red text in the developer console.</p>
<p class="note warning">This is a Warning Message. Note the triangle symbol at the left and yellow background color.</p>

<h3>Rule Out Browser Related Issues</h3>
<section class="collapsible">
    <header class="collapsible-header">I Am Self-Hosting</header>
        <div class="collapsible-content">  
<ol>
    <li>Launch Foundry VTT as normal.</li>
    <li>Open an incognito or private tab in a web browser and go to <code>http://localhost:30000</code> to connect to Foundry VTT.</li>
    <li><strong>The Issue Does Not Persist:</strong> The cause of the issue is likely a problem with browser extensions or the standalone Foundry VTT application. You can use Foundry VTT normally by accessing it via web browser.</li>
    <li><strong>The Issue Persists:</strong> The issue is likely not browser related. Proceed to the next section.</li>
</ol>
                </div>

<section class="collapsible">
    <header class="collapsible-header">I Use a Remote Host</header>
        <div class="collapsible-content">  
                <li>Connect to Foundry VTT as normal using either a private browser window, or a browser you don't commonly use.</li>
                <li><strong>The Issue Does Not Persist:</strong> A browser extension may be interfering with Foundry VTT, or you're using an unsupported browser. Foundry VTT supports Chrome, Edge, Opera (not Opera GX), and Firefox.</li>
                <li><strong>The Issue Persists:</strong> The issue is likely not browser related. Proceed to the next section.</li>
                </div>
</section>
<h3>Rule Out World, System, or Foundry VTT Specific Issues</h3>
<p>If the issue persists after disabling all modules, the next step will be determining if it's an issue with the World itself, the Game System, or with Foundry VTT. Update After each step, check for errors in the developer console. Do not enable any modules during this process.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Return to Setup and create a new World with the same game system.</li>
    <li>Launch this World and attempt to reproduce the issue.</li>
    <li><strong>The Issue Does Not Persist:</strong> The cause of the issue is related to something in the World itself.</li>
    <li><strong>The issue Persists:</strong> Create a new World in a different Game System. Attempt to reproduce the issue again. If it persists, the issue is likely a problem with Foundry VTT itself. If not, the issue is with the system you're using in the affected World.</li>
</ol>

<section class="collapsible">
    <header class="collapsible-header">Resolving World, Game System, or Foundry VTT Issues</header>

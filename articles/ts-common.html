<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This article covers troubleshooting steps for common issues in Foundry. After completing each step, check your world to see if the issue remains. If the issue is still there after you've completed all the Basic Troubleshooting steps, we strongly recommend that you <a href="/contact-us/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">contact us</a> or join our <a href="https://discord.gg/foundryvtt" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Discord community</a> for live support.</p> </p>

<h2 class="border">Troubleshooting Steps</h2>
<h3>Basic Troubleshooting</h3>
<ol>

    <li>Refresh and Clear Browser Cache: With the world loaded, hold down 'Ctrl'/'Cmd'and press 'F5' to refresh Foundry.</li>
    
    <li> Launch World in Safe Configuration: While modules are a popular feature of Foundry, conflicts between them or outdated modules can lead to unexpected problems. Launching your world in Safe Configuration is the fastest and easiest way to check if modules are the cause of your problem. To do this, navigate to the Worlds screen and find the world with issues. Press 'Edit World' and then check 'Launch in Safe Configuration'. When you launch the world, Foundry will disable all modules, deactivate all scenes, and stop playing all tracks. To save time, please do not re-enable any modules until you are finished troubleshooting. </li>
    
    <li>Restart Foundry: If you're using the standalone Foundry application, close out of Foundry entirely. Then launch Foundry again. Load the world and check if the issue remains. If you're using a <a href="/article/partnerships/">Hosting Partner</a>, follow their steps to restart Foundry.</li>

    <li>Update Systems and Modules: Return to Setup and navigate to the Game Systems screen. Press the 'Update All' button to update your game systems to their latest version.</li>
    
    <li>Use an Incognito Window or Different Browser: Sometimes unsupported browsers or certain browser extensions interfere with Foundry. Connect to your Foundry instance in an incognito/private tab, or a different browser. If you're using the standalone Foundry application, go to <a href="http://localhost:30000">http://localhost:30000</a> in your web browser to directly connect to Foundry.</li>

    <li>Reinstall Game System: Return to Setup and navigate to the Game Systems screen. Find the game system your world uses, eg 'DnD5e', then click on 'Uninstall.' Click 'Yes' when the warning prompt comes up. After the game game system is uninstalled, click 'Install System', navigate to the relevant system, and click 'Install.' Then load the world and check if the issue continues.</li>
 
    <li>Update Foundry: Finally, if the issue still isn't resolved, check that Foundry is up to date with the latest <strong>Stable</strong> build. Navigate to the Administration screen and check that you're using the <strong>Stable</strong> release channel. <b>Do not upgrade to a Prototype, Development, or Testing version!</b> Press "Check for Updates", and then "Download" if an update exists.
</ol>

<h3>Advanced Troubleshooting</h3>
<p>If the above steps do not resolve the issue then we strongly recommend you <a href="/contact-us/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">contact us</a> or join our <a href="https://discord.gg/foundryvtt" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Discord community</a> for live support. We may ask that you perform a few more troubleshooting steps to help find the cause of the issue. They are described below for your reference.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Check Another Scene: Check that all your modules are disabled and then create a new scene. Check if the issue continues in this scene, or if it's isolated to specific scene(s).</li>
    <li>Check Another World: Create a new world with the same game system and do not activate any modules. Check in that world if the issue continues. This helps to rule out possible issues with your game world.</li>
    <li>Try A Different Game System: Click on 'Return to Setup' if your world is active. Create a new world with a different game system. Check if the issue continues to happen in this world. Similar to checking another world and scene, this helps rule out an issue with your game system.</li>
    <li>Check the Console: Press F12 to open up the Developer Tools panel. Select the tab titled 'Console' and check for any error messages in red text. If there are any, get a screenshot or copy and paste them into a text file.</li>
    <li>Check for Errors: You may be asked to provide or check Foundry's error log. To find the error log, navigate to your <a href="/article/user-data/">User Data</a> folder, then open the Logs directory. The error log is named 'error.txt'.</li>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Folders are available for organizing user created material across most of the application's sidebars. Their function is identical in all place, allowing for quick creation of documents in them, and using drag-and-drop functions to move items quickly.</p>

<h2 class="border">Creating Folders</h2>

<p>The <i class="fas fa-folder"> </i> <strong>Create Folder</strong> button allows you to create a folder in the sidebar/directory where it appears. This will pop up the folder creation dialog, prompting you to give the folder a name set a folder color if you want to.</p>
<p>Once a folder has been created, you can drag and drop documents and other folders from the sidebar into the newly created folder to organize them as desired. You can also click on folders to expand them, showing all of the contained documents, or click an expanded folder to collapse it, hiding the contained documents.</p>

<h4>Sorting Folders & Content</h4>
<p>Folders default to using alphabetic sorting, which automatically sorts all subfolders and items in them alphabetically. By setting a folder to manual sorting, you can click and drag to rearrange folders however you choose. Folders can only be rearranged this way if they are collapsed first.</p>
<p>Top-level Folders contained in a sidebar are always manually sorted.</p>

<h4>Creating Subfolders</h4>
<p>Clicking the Folder icon (<i class="fas fa-folder"> </i>) on a folder itself will open the folder creation dialog, allowing you to make a new subfolder. This subfolder works identically to all other folders.</p>

<h4>Creating Documents in a Folder</h4>
<p>Clicking the Create New Document icon will open creation dialog related to the document type associated with that folder (actors, items, scenes, etc.), allowing them to be automatically placed into that folder. The icon for this will match the one used for the sidebar you're in (Actors <i class="fas fa-user"> </i>, Items <i class="fas fa-suitcase"> </i>, Etc.) but will have a small plus sign (<i class="fas fa-plus"> </i>) next to it.</p>

<h4>Folder Related Sidebar Elements</h4>

	<dd>This searches for and lists any actors whose names match the given string of text entered into the search bar.</dd>
	
	<dt>Collapse All Folders (<i class="fas fa-sort-amount-up"> </i>)</dt>
	<dd>This collapses all folders, showing only the top-level folders and any actors not sorted into a folder.</dd>

<p>Right clicking a folder allows you to access a number of specific functions that manipulate the folders and its content. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Edit Folder</strong> (<i class="fas fa-edit"> </i>): This options allows you to modify the folder, changing its display name, setting a folder color, and determining what default sorting method it should us.</li>
<li><strong>Configure Permissions</strong> (<i class="fas fa-lock"> </i>): This options allows you to configure the permissions of the folder to decide what level of user can see the documents within. This uses the same permission guidelines found in the @Article[users] article.</li>
<li><strong>Export to Compendium</strong> (<i class="fas fa-atlas"> </i>): This will prompt you to select an unlocked compendium that matches the type of document contained in the folder, allowing you to export the contents of the folder to the selected compendium.</li>
<li><strong>Create Rollable Table</strong> (<i class="fas fa-th-list"> </i>): This option creates a new rollable table using the contents of the folder. It will prompt you for confirmation before doing so.</li>
<li><strong>Remove Folder</strong> (<i class="fas fa-trash"> </i>): This option deletes the folder and drops all contained documents into the directory instead of deleting them. If the folder was in a folder, it places the documents in that folder instead.</li>
<li><strong>Delete All</strong> (<i class="fas fa-dumpster"> </i>): This option deletes the folder and all of its contents.</li>
</ul>

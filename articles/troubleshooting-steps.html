<p>This article covers troubleshooting steps for common issues in Foundry. After completing each step, check your world to see if the issue remains. If it does not, proceed to the next step. If the issues remain after completing these steps, please CONTACTUS</p>

<h2 class="border">Basic Troubleshooting Steps</h2>
<ol>

    <li>Refresh and Clear Browser Cache - With the world loaded, hold down 'Ctrl'/'Cmd'and press 'F5' to refresh Foundry.</li>
    
    <li> Launch World in Safe Configuration - From the Setup screen, find the world with issues. Press 'Edit World' and then check 'Launch in Safe Configuration'. When you launch the world, Foundry will disable all modules, deactivate all scenes, and stop playing all tracks. To save timee, please do not re-enable any modules until you are finished troubleshooting. </li>
    
    <li>Restart Foundry - If you're using the standalone Foundry application, close out of Foundry entirely. Then launch Foundry again. Load the world and check if the issue remains. If you're using a <a href="/article/partnerships/">Hosting Partner</a>, follow their steps to restart Foundry.</li>

    <li>Update Systems and Modules - Return to Setup and navigate to the Game Systems screen. Press the 'Update All' button to update your game systems to their latest version.</li>
    
    <li>Use an Incognito Window or Different Browser - Sometimes unsupported browsers or certain browser extensions interfere with Foundry. Connect to your Foundry instance in an incognito/private tab, or a different browser. If you're using the standalone Foundry application, go to <a href="http://localhost:30000">http://localhost:30000</a> in your web browser to directly connect to it.</li>
 
    <li>Update Foundry - Finally, if the issue still isn't resolved, check that Foundry is up to date with the latest <strong>Stable</strong> build. Navigate to the Administration screen and check that you're using the <strong>Stable</strong> release channel. <b>Do not upgrade to a Prototype, Development, or Testing version!</b> Press "Check for Updates", and then "Download" if an update exists.

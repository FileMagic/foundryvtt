<li>Refresh and Clear Browser Cache - Hold down 'Ctrl'/'Cmd'and press 'F5' to refresh Foundry and clear your browser's cache</li>
 <!-- TODO: Less technical wording, reword "clear browser's cache" -->
<li> Launch World in Safe Configuration - From the Setup screen, find the world with issues. Press 'Edit World' and then check 'Launch in Safe Configuration'. When you launch the world, Foundry will disable all modules, deactivate all scenes, and stop playing all tracks. </li>
<li>Restart Foundry Standalone Client: Close out of Foundry entirely and then launch it again. Linux/NodeJS: End Foundry's process by pressing `Ctrl + C', or using your process manager's commands.</li>
<!-- TODO: Linux/NodeJS necessary? -->
<li> Using an Incognito Window or Different Browser - Sometimes unsupported browsers or certain browser extensions interfere with Foundry. Connect to your Foundry instance in an incognito/private tab, or a different browser. If you're using the standalone client, go to `http://localhost:30000` in your browser of choice.</li>
<!-- TODO: Make localhost:30000 clickable? -->

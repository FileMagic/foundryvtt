<p>Foundry VTT stores your User Data in a separate directory than the core software. This directory contains worlds, assets, modules, and configuration settings used by Foundry VTT.</p>

<p>This article will guide you through the process of backing up your User Data and migrating to a new version of Foundry Virtual Tabletop or your Game System. We recommend making regular backups, especially before moving your data or updating Foundry Virtual Tabletop.</p>
<!-- Warning about synchronized backup services -->
<h3>Danger of Data Sync Backup Services</h3>
<p>Data sync services such as those offered by Dropbox, Google Drive, and Microsoft OneDrive, are not compatible with Foundry VTT. Foundry VTT makes frequent changes to your World's database files while running. A data sync service will inevitably copy these databases mid-operation, then restore them to this state later on. This leads to database corruption and irreversible data loss. Never use a data sync service with Foundry VTT! You will permanently lose your work.</p>

 <h2 class="border">Restoring Your User Data</h2>
 <p>Restoring your data is as simple as closing Foundry VTT and replacing the Data, Config, and Logs directories with your backed up data. <b>Always check that your backup contains your data before overwriting or deleting any existing content.</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Windows and MacOS - Use the steps from the previous section to navigate to your User Data folder. Replace its contents with your backup.</li>
    <li>Linux - Use the steps from the previous section to find the path to your User Data. Copy the .tar.gz file to there and navigate to the directory using <code>cd /path/to/userdata/here</code>. Then enter the command <code>tar -xvf foundry-backup.tar.gz</code>, replacing "foundry-backup" with your archive name.</li>
</ul>
<p>After doing this, launch Foundry Virtual Tabletop as normal.</p>

<h2 class="border">Moving Your User Data</h2>
<p>Moving your User Data to a new location requires just a few simple steps. Before you do so, you should first perform a complete backup of your existing data.</p>

<!-- Running a different version of Foundry -->
<!-- Overview -->
<h2 class="border">Overview</h2>
<p>This article explains how to run a different version of Foundry Virtual Tabletop, as well as how to revert to an older version. If you are moving to an older version of Foundry Virtual Tabletop and want to use the same worlds, you <b>must</b> have a backup of those worlds from the same version you're moving to, or older. Worlds can not be reverted to work in older versions of Foundry VTT.</p>

<h2 class="border">Before You Begin</h2>
<p>Before you change versions of Foundry VTT, you should always back up your User Data. If you update to a newer version and launch a World, that World will be updated to work with the newer version. This process can not be reversed if you choose to revert to an older version. See @Article[ts-backup-migrate] for instructions on how to back up your User Data.</p>

<h2 class="border">Run a Different Version of Foundry VTT</h2>
<p>Running a different version requires uninstalling Foundry VTT, then downloading and installing the version you're changing to. If you wish to change to an older version of Foundry VTT, follow the steps here and then proceed to the section titled "I am Switching to an Older Version of Foundry VTT."</p>
<ol>
    <li>Uninstall Foundry Virtual Tabletop.</li>
    <li>Navigate to your <a href="http://www.foundryvtt.com/me/licenses">Purchased Licenses</a> page in your web browser.</a></li>
    <li>Select which version of Foundry Virtual Tabletop you wish to change to in the menu next to 'Download Version'. Ensure that you've selected the appropriate operating system in the dropdown menu below that, then click 'Download.'</li>
   <li>Install Foundry Virtual Tabletop as normal.</li> 
</ol>

<p>If you do not see your Worlds on the 'Worlds' page, proceed to "My Worlds Aren't Showing Up."</p>

<h3>I Am Switching to an Older Version of Foundry VTT</h3>
<p>Worlds in Foundry VTT are not backwards compatible. As soon as a World has been opened in a new version of Foundry VTT, its data is migrated to work with that newer version and it can not be reverted. If you have a backup compatible with the version you're switching to, you can replace your User Data with that backup and then use your Worlds as normal.</p>

    <ol>
     <li>Locate your User Data directory by launching Foundry VTT, navigating to the Configuration screen, and following the path listed next to 'User Data Path.' Close out of Foundry VTT.</li>
     <li>Replace the 'Data' folder with your backed up 'Data' folder.</li>
     <li>Launch Foundry VTT again.</li>
     <li>Check if your Worlds show on the 'Worlds' page.</li>
    </ol>

<h3>My Worlds Aren't Displayed</h3>
<p>There are two common reasons why a different version of Foundry VTT isn't displaying your worlds.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Bad User Data Path - Confirm that 'User Data Path' on the Configuration screen is pointing to the proper directory.</li>
    <li>Incompatible Worlds - Worlds are not backwards compatible. If have changed to an older version, you will need to replace your User Data with a backup from that version of Foundry VTT.</li>
</ul>

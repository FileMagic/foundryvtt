<p>We have overhauled the Manifest definition to reduce user errors and allow for more powerful definitions. With the new <code>relationships</code> field, we have a powerful framework for future relationship types.</p>
<p class="note info"><strong>Note:</strong> per the KB style guide, classes and methods referenced in paragraphs should be wrapped in <code>code strings</code>. DO NOT USE CODE ELEMENTS INSIDE HEADERS.</p>
<h2 id="deprecation-period">Deprecation Period: V13</h2>
<p>If applicable, you would briefly discuss the deprecation periodization for the API functions replaced by the new period here.</p>
<h2 class="border">Automated Migration API</h2>
<p>If an api function has been introduced to migrate data structures from v9 to v10, discuss how to use it and what it does here.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">
    Your migration code usage example would go in here.
</code></pre>
<h2 id="your-id-here" class="border">Human-readable Heading</h2>
<p>The body of the document should be composed in a way that is easily readable. Use an H3 to indicate the division between the old way of doing things and the new way. I suggest making use of the below flexrow section to put the before-and-after side-by-side. Use this paragraph to introduce what changed and why it changed to the new model (if applicable)</p>
<section class="flexrow">
    <div>
        <h3>V9</h3>
        <pre><code class="lang-js">
            Your old code usage example would go in here.
        </code></pre>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>V10</h3>
        <pre><code class="lang-js">
            Your new code usage example would go in here.
        </code></pre>
    </div>
</section>
<h2 id="your-id-here" class="border">Related Links</h2>
<p>Use h2's 'border' class to draw clean lines between new pieces of migration guidance by subsectioning the article for easy reading. Where relevant, links to important github issues or API pages should be included in the last section of the page.</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/admin/articles/article/108/change/linkhere" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Link to Github Issue</a></li>
    <li><a href="/admin/articles/article/108/change/linkhere" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Link to API doc page</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This article covers various causes for Foundry VTT displaying your scene as a black or gray box. In many cases, gray or black screens can be fixed with just a few short steps. Not all of the steps listed here apply in all cases. Determine the most likely cause from the options below and begin there.</p>

<h2 class="border">Foundry VTT Shows a Black Screen</h2>

<!-- Blurb, h3? -->
<h3>Scene and Token Settings</h3>
<p>Typically a black screen is due to vision settings or modules. The following addresses how to check and correct these</p>

<p>Scenes and tokens have several settings that work together to display the scene to the player. The scene will show as black to a player or when a Token is selected if they're configured improperly.</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Scene Settings: Check that the Scene is not zoomed into a black part of the map. If 'Token Vision' checked in the Scene's Lighting section and Global Illumination is unchecked, tokens will need Lights, or have values set for their vision.</li>
        <li>Token Settings: Check that 'Has Vision' is checked under the token's Vision tab. If no Lights are on the scene, tokens with vision require a Dim or Bright Vision radius to see.</li>
       </ul> 

<h3>Module Errors</h3>
<p>Out of date modules or module conflicts can cause a Scene to display a black box instead of loading properly. To check this and begin the p Safe Configuration following. The article <a href="/article/launch-safe-configuration/">Launch a Foundry Virtual Tabletop World in Safe Configuration</a> explains how.</p>

<p>The following lists other common reasons for both black and gray screens, as well as their solutions.</p>

<h3>A Warning Related to Hardware Acceleration Appeared</h3>
<p>Foundry VTT requires Hardware Acceleration to run properly and smoothly. If this is disabled, you may get a black or gray screen. Enabling Hardware Acceleration usually resolves this.</p>

        <p>Use the relevant set of steps to enable Hardware Acceleration in your browser or the standalone Foundry application. If you're using Windows, you may need to use the last set of steps to prevent Windows from overriding Hardware Acceleration settings.</p>

        
        <h4>Enable Hardware Acceleration in Chrome</h4>
        <ol>   
            <li>Open Chrome and enter <code>chrome://settings</code> in the location bar at the top of the screen.</li>
            <li>Click on <strong>System</strong> on the menu on the left.</li>
            <li>Enable <strong>Use hardware acceleration when available</strong>.</li>
            <li>Enter <code>chrome://flags</code> in the location bar.</li>
            <li>Enable <strong>Override software rendering list</strong>.</li>
            <li>Close out of all Chrome windows and relaunch Chrome.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Enable Hardware Acceleration in Firefox</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Open Firefox and enter <code>about:config</code>. If a warning page shows, click <strong>Accept the Risk and Continue</strong>. Enabling Hardware Acceleration for Foundry VTT will not compromise your security. .</li>
            <li>Search for <code>layers.acceleration.force-enabled</code> in the top search bar</li>
            <li>Click the two arrows on the right hand side. The bottom of the search results should say <strong>True</strong></li>
            <li>Close out of all Firefox windows and relaunch Firefox.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Enable Hardware Acceleration in the standalone Foundry VTT Application</h4> 
        <ul>
            <li>MacOS: Open a terminal and enter <code>open -a FoundryVTT --args ignore-gpu-blocklist</code> </li>
            <li>Linux: Open a terminal in your Foundry VTT installation directory and enter <code>./foundryvtt --ignore-gpu-blocklist</code></li>
         </ul> 
            
        <p>On Windows, enabling Hardware Acceleration in the standalone Foundry VTT application requires several steps.</p>
        <ol>

                <li>Windows: Navigate to to your Foundry installation folder.</li>
                <li>Right click on 'foundryvtt.exe', and click 'Create Shortcut.'</li>
                <li>click the shortcut and select 'Properties.'</li>
                <li>In the 'Target' field, add a space and enter <code>--ignore-gpu-blocklist</code>. The field should look similar to <code>"C:\...\FoundryVTT.exe" --ignore-gpu-blocklist</code>, where "..." is the path to your Foundry VTT installation folder. Note that the addition is outside of the quotes. </li>
                <li>Press 'OK', and then use this shortcut to launch Foundry VTT from now on.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Windows Hardware Acceleration</h4>
        <p>If Foundry VTT still warns that Hardware Acceleration is disabled, Windows may be overriding your browser's settings. This usually happens on notebook PCs with a dedicated GPU. The following steps explain how to check and correct this.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Press your Windows key, type "Settings", and press 'Enter.'</li>
                <li>Click on 'Display' on the lefthand side, then scroll down and click on 'Graphics Settings.'</li>
                <li>Select "Classic App" from the drop down menu.</li>
                <li>Click 'Browse', then find and select your browser or Foundry Virtual Tabletop executable</li>
                <li>Click the 'Options' button and select the appropriate GPU. Typically this is the "High Performance" option.</li>
                <li>Click 'Save.'</li>
            </ol>

<!-- Bad image path -->
<h3>Missing Background Image or Bad Path</h3>
<p>If your background image has been renamed or moved, Foundry VTT will display a gray screen in place of the scene. To resolve this, check that the Background Image path in the <a href="/article/scenes/">Scene's</a> is correct and that the file exists on your file system.</p>

<h3>Low Hard Drive Space</h3>
<p>If you have less than 4 GB of free space on your boot drive (usually the C drive for Windows users), Chromium based browsers such as Chrome, Edge, or the one used in the standalone Foundry VTT application, will not load and store images properly. This is accompanied with an error message in the developer console that includes the words "Failed to fetch." Freeing up more than 4 GB of space on your boot drive will resolve this.</p>

        <p>Network problems between the host server and users are another cause of gray screens.

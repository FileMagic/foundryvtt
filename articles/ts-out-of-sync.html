<!-- Overview -->
<h2 class="border">Overview</h2>
<p>This article covers common reasons for players being out of sync with the Foundry VTT host. Typically this happens when something interferes with a player's connection to the host. Signs of this include:
    <ul>
        <li>Changes to Actors, Items, or Journal Entries not saving</li>
        <li>Token movement reverting</li>
        <li>Disconnections</li>
        <li>Foundry VTT Doesn't Respond</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<!-- Overview: Signs of out of sync -->

<!-- Before you begin
--Ctrl + F5 refresh -->
<h2 class="border">Before You Begin</h2>
<p>Pressing 'Ctrl' + 'F5' is usually enough to at least temporarily resolve the above issues. Sometimes the cause of these issues is difficult to pin down, especially if it only affects your players. Asking a player to connect and help test can help speed up the troubleshooting process.</p>

<!-- Module Errors
    -- Disable all
    -- Search for culprit
-->
<h2 class="border">Module Overload</h2>
<p>While add-on modules are a popular feature of Foundry Virtual Tabletop, using too many at once can lead to delays and the desync issues described above.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Disable all modules by launching your World in Safe Configuration. See @Article[launch-safe-configuration] for instructions.</li>
    <li>Check if the error persists.</li>
    <li>If it does: Proceed to the next section.</li>
    <li>If it does not: One or more modules are causing Foundry VTT to desync from player clients. See the collapsible below for instructions on finding the module at fault.</li>
</ol>

    <header class="collapsible-header">Narrow Down the Module at Fault</header>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
        <p>Finding the module at fault for your performance issues may seem like a daunting task if you have dozens or hundreds of modules. Fortunately there's a quick method to narrow down the offending module compared to enabling and disabling one by one. You will divide your modules into two groups, and then further divide these groups in half depending on if the issue returns or not.</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Enable half of your modules.</li>
        <li>If the issue returns: the module at fault is in this group. Enable half of this group, and check again.</li> 
        <li>If the issue does not return: the module at fault is in the other group of modules. Enable that group and check again.</li>
       </ul> 
       <p>Repeat this process until only one module remains. This will be the module at fault.</p>

<h2 class="border">Browser and Network Settings</h2>
<p>Browsers and network settings are two other causes for players desyncing with Foundry VTT.</p>

<h3>Browser Settings and Extensions</h3>
<p>Chromium based browsers such as Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge will automatically set unused or unfocused tabs to an idle state. This disrupts the connection between player and host. Players should keep active the tab that Foundry VTT is running in, or return to it after viewing other tabs.</p>
<p>Browser extensions can also cause desync errors. Try connecting to Foundry VTT using an Incognito window or using another supported browser without extensions.</p>

<h3>Network Related Causes</h3>
<p>Automated port forwarding through UPnP or misconfigured network settings can also cause desync issues.</p>

<h4>I Am Self Hosting But Didn't Need to Port Forward</h4>
<p>Foundry VTT attempts to make an automatic port forwarding rule in your browser using a framework called Universal Plug and Play (UPnP). Generally if this works then connections are fine. Sometimes however UPnP can cause connection issues. To fix this we suggest you set up port forwarding manually. See @Article[port-forwarding] for instructions on how to do this. Restarting your router by unplugging its power for 30 seconds may provide a temporary resolution if port forwarding is not feasible at the current time.</p>

<h4>I Am Using a Reverse Proxy or SSL</h4>
<p>Check that your reverse proxy and Foundry VTT's SSL settings are configured properly. Guides for doing this with Caddy, Nginx, Apache, and SSL setup, are below.</p>
